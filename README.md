# ðŸ‘‹ Hey, I'm Gui Domingues â€” Design Engineer

I craft thoughtful digital experiences from pixel to production.  
Blending strategy, design and development to build robust, high-performance websites and scalable interfaces.

## What I do

As a Design Engineer, I bring interfaces to life with a strong focus on clarity, scalability, and performance:

- **Design Systems & UI** â€” I create and maintain design systems using Figma, ensuring consistency and velocity.
- **Precise Development** â€” I develop pixel-perfect UIs with `React`, `Next.js`, `TypeScript`, `Tailwind CSS`, and `Shadcn UI`, prioritizing accessibility and responsiveness.
- **Custom WordPress Development** â€” I build WordPress websites from scratch with custom themes, ACF, and optimized plugins. Focused on speed, SEO, and ease of management.
