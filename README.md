# Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Gui Domingues, a dedicated Design Engineer.

I excel in crafting high-performance, accessible websites, focusing on best practices and clean code. My expertise spans across the full design to development lifecycle, integrating aesthetic appeal with functional efficiency.

## Specializations

As a Design Engineer, I bridge the gap between design and development, creating cohesive and scalable design systems. I'm deeply involved in:

- **Designing with Figma:** Crafting detailed style guides, design systems, and UI/UX designs that serve as the foundation for robust websites.
- **Developing with Passion:** Utilizing a tech stack that includes `.php`, `.js`, `.ts`, `.html`, `.css`, `.scss`, `.svg` to bring designs to life with code that prioritizes performance, accessibility, and maintainability.
